Practice 1

// Assessment 1/

//1. Develop an algorithm in scala that calculates the radius of a circle

// We declare three variables
// In the first variable is where we assign the value that the circumference will take
// In another variable we assign the value of pi
// In the third variable we will perform the operation according to the formula to calculate the radius of a circle.
// And finally the command to print the value thrown in our third variable


val  cir = 10
val  pi = 3.1416
val  r = cir/pi*2
println(r)


//2. Develop an algorithm in scala that tells me if a number is a cousin

// We declare two variables
// In the first one where we enter the number we want to know if it is a cousin or not
// In the second one a counter starting at zero
// We created a FOR cycle to record the number of times the number was divisible
// We created an IF to verify that the condition of the number to be divided was met by checking that the residue was 0
// Creating the condition if the counter was divisible by the same number and by 1
// We create another IF where if the counter is different from two means that the number will not be a prime number
// Then with the function to print to send as text “Number not cousin” or “He is cousin”


val  numero = 5
var  cont=0
for ( i<-Rango (1, número )) 
{
 if (numero % i == 0) 
 {
   cont+=1
 }
}
if (cont!=2) {
println (" Numero no primo ")
} más {
println ( " El numero es primo " )
}


//3. Given the variable bird = "tweet", use string interpolation to print "I am writing a tweet"

// We create a variable called bird that hosts the word “tweet”
// Create a variable called interpolate with default text and interpolate the bird variable created earlier so the text is shown interpolating the text of the word within the variable


val  bird  =  " tweet "
val  interpolar  =  " Estoy escribiendo un " + bird

//4. Given the variable message = "Hi Luke, I'm your father!" use slice to extract the sequence "Luke"

// Create a variable to enter the text by default
// We link the variable to the slice function that will show us what is in the space from 5 to 10 within the default text

val  star  =  " Hola Luke Yo soy tu padre "
    star.slice ( 5 , 10 )

//5. What is the difference in value and a variable in scala?
// The variable can change in value and is called a mutable variable
// The value is a variable that cannot change its value and is called an immutable variable.


//6. Given the tuple ((2,4,5), (1,2,3), (3,116,23))) return the number 3.1416

// Create a variable with the assigned values
// print the variable with the property to show us the position we want according to the number
 
val  tupla  = (( 2 , 4 , 5 ), ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), ( 3.1416 , 23 ))
println (tupla._3)
